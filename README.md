# zooid-story
This repo contains the  story of this company's  journey from scratch to top
At the time zooid is just a visual thought of me (Krishna) and Its so. I am working on a 9-5 job in a lockdown time and wanting to shift to a better job for making a better life for family.

I have a dream a strong dream and I can only see a tip of the iceberg of my dream and cant make my decision based on it.
With the previuos experience I CANNOT take risk at any cost and I hate to do that at this point of time. More story to come

After long time I started working on zooid and although i have been reading vuejs and stuff its been a big challenge to event create single button  component. But whatever it is this is the start.

Its been quite 2 months before I could restart actively Zooid, When I think of the idea sometimes it lights the situation and sometimes it makes me feel If I will be wasting my time. This thought keeps repeating and I have started to shun it for the good. The arguement is that if I am not doing this then do I have anything else that I can try? if not then this is what I have in my head. So better save energy for the work than this thought, unless some new better idea pops which can stop me.

Doing everything on my own takes a lot of energy and I am getting used to it.
